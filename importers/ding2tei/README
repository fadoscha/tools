ding2tei-haskell
================

A program to convert the Ding [0] dictionary into the TEI [1] format, to be
used within the FreeDict project [2].

This program was written as part of a Bachelor's thesis.  See doc/thesis.pdf.


Dependencies
------------

* Haskell (Glasgow Haskell Compiler / GHC)
  * base
  * containers (Data.Map, Data.Set)
  * transformers (Control.Monad.Trans.State)
  * pretty (Text.PrettyPrint)
  * haskell-xml (Text.XML.Light)
* Happy
* Alex

On Debian-based distributions:

# apt install ghc libghc-xml-dev happy alex


Locale
------

Use a UTF-8 locale, otherwise some things might produce unexpected results or
even fail.  In particular, do not use the C locale.


Obtain the data
---------------

The Ding source can be obtained here:

 https://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/Local/urz/ding/de-en/

Currently this program targets version 1.8.1.  Expect things to fail with other
versions.

Store the uncompressed file at:

 dingsrc/de-en.txt


How to build
------------

$ cd src

$ alex Language/Ding/AlexScanner.x
$ happy Language/Ding/Parser/Line.y

$ ghc -Wall -O2 -XRecursiveDo Main -o ../ding2tei


How to run
----------

Note: The program currently allocates a lot of memory, around 4.5 GiB, when
      applied to the full Ding source.

$ src/preprocess/de-en/all.sh < dingsrc/de-en.txt \
    > dingsrc/de-en.txt.preprocessed
$ ./ding2tei dingsrc/de-en.txt.preprocessed deu-eng.tei
$ ./ding2tei -i dingsrc/de-en.txt.preprocessed eng-deu.tei


How to test (manually)
----------------------

$ cd src
$ ghci -XRecursiveDo Test.hs
>> parseLine $ scan "some dictionary :: line\n"
>> pretty $ parseLine $ scan (examples !! 0)
>> ding = parse $ scan $ header ++ (concat examples)
>> pretty ding
>> tei = ding2tei $ enrichDirected $ enrichUndirected ding
>> putStr $ prettyTEI $ tei
>> tailParse "filename" nInitialLinesDropped
>> :q

$ ./ding2tei doc/examples/test.ding test.tei

Notes on usage with the FreeDict tools
--------------------------------------

To use the resulting TEI files with the FreeDict tools:

1.  Create a directory named as the ISO-639-3 language pair (e.g., deu-eng) and
    place the generated TEI file (e.g., deu-eng.tei) inside.
2.  Create a minimal Makefile in this directory:

    ```
    DISTFILES = deu-eng.tei

    include $(FREEDICT_TOOLS)/mk/dicts.mk
    ```
3.  See <https://github.com/freedict/tools> for more information.
    Note: `make' must be provided with a FREEDICT_TOOLS [environment] variable.


Licensing
---------

ding2tei-haskell is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License

See the license headers in the source files and the license itself for details
(should be supplied with this program under the name COPYING).

The Ding source is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version
2 or later.  In the context of this program, version 3 of the license should be
considered, since it allows combining with the AGPLv3.  (Likely, later versions
will also allow combining.)

The combination of the Ding dictionary and this program form a combined work,
the resulting TEI dictionary is an "object form" of this combined work, in
terms of both the GPL and AGPL.
