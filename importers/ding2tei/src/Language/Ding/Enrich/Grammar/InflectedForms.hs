 - From a set of grammar annotations on a unit, infer others to apply to the
 - same unit.
 -
 - Note that this works on grammar elements which are common to the Ding and
 - TEI, however this module is deliberately placed under `Language.Ding',
 - because the enrichment depends on inference rules which are particular to
 - the Ding.  E.g. `{f}' implies that the corresponding unit is a noun, in the
 - Ding.  There may however, in general, very well be other parts of speach
 - bearing a gender.
