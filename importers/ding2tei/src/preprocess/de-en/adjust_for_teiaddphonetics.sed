# teiaddphonetics (espeak-ng) fails with the below pattern unaltered.
#  * Actually, it seems fine if there is no [[:alphanum:]] somewhere left
#    of the below pattern, in the enclosing unit.  This is unlikely to ever
#    occur in practice though (and it does not in version 1.8.1 of the Ding).
#  * The alteration is not very nice, but likely the least invasive that makes
#    teiaddphonetics work.
#  * One might also consider to make this alteration on the TEI output.
#    * Note that the pattern is only a problem, when part of an element that is
#      to be amended with phonetics information (i.e., when part of a
#      headword).
#  * Unsure, whether the below actually catches all problematic cases
#    (teiaddphonetics usually runs for 20 hours or so before spitting out the
#    first error.)
#    * Run teiaddphonetics with `--espeak-count 1' to get a proper error
#      message.
