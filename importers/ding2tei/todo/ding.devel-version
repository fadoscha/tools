Not only support version 1.8.1, but also "devel"
 - split preprocess/*.sed files#

Note that "devel" is ever-changing, there is no (known) way of accessing old
"devel" versions.

Some words have disappeared in the devel version of the Ding
- ex.: "Aggregationsreagenz" (and surrounding)
- The web version of the Ding seems to be based on a third version of the Ding
  - has "Aggregationsreagens" (final "s", not "z")
